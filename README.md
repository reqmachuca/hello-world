# hello-world
A repository reflecting my initiation into the GitHub multi-verse!

Hello all, my initials read REM, like the deep-sleep cycle. I am very excited to finally use GitHub. The first to follow me is my sister, who is one my steadfast allies in this world. I am a third-year undergrad who aspires to be an engineer of biological systems. Nature has taught me humility.
